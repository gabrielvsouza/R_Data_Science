Three general guiding principles that motivate what we learn here are 
1 be systematic when organizing your file system
2 automize when possible
3 minimize the use of the mouse.

As you become more proficient at coding, and you will find that 
1 you want to minimize the time you spend remembering what you call something or where you put it.
2 if you find yourself repeating the same task over and over,there's probably a way to automize it.
3 times your fingers leave the keyboard,

it results in loss of productivity.
A typical data analysis challenge may involve several parts,
each involving several data files, including files containing
the scripts we use to analyze data.

Keeping all this organized can be challenging.
We will learn to use the Unix shell as a tool for managing files
and folders on your computer system.
Using Unix will permit you to use the keyboard, rather than the mouse, when
creating folders, moving from folder to folder,
and renaming, deleting, or moving files.

We also provide specific suggestions on how to keep the file system organized.
The data analysis process is iterative and adaptive.
As a result, we are constantly editing our scripts and reports.

Git, is a powerful tool for keeping track of these changes.
We also introduced you to GitHub, a service that permits
you to host and share your code.
We will also demonstrate how you can use this service
to facilitate collaborations.
Note that a side effect of using Github
is that you can easily showcase your work to potential employers.

Finally, we learned to write reports in R markdown, which
permits you to incorporate text and code into a single document.
We will demonstrate how using the knitr package we can write reproducible
and aesthetically pleasing reports by running the analysis
and generating the report simultaneously.
